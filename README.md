# SimpleChat
**Simple Peer-to-Peer chat, written by me when I was only starting out with C#.**

This chat requires that 2 clients on the same LAN network forward the port that they are planning to use.
In order to connect, both clients have to know each other's IP and socket address. If connection is successfull,
the user is prompted to choose their nickname for the session. From that point onwards, 2 clients can speak to each other freely.

Since essentially both clients act as each other's server, this chat is peer-to-peer.

Ignore any bad practices (of which there are probably many) that you may encounter - I was really young back then.
Same goes for any bugs that you ecounter. Since this project is long abandoned, 
I'm not planning on fixing anything - it does what it was intended to do well enough. Feel free to fix it for yourself if you want though.
